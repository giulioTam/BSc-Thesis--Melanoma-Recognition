# Skin Lesion Classification – ISIC Challenge 2016
📅 Project originally developed in 2021
This repository was uploaded later for archival purposes.

This repository contains the material developed for the **Bachelor’s Thesis** of *Giulio Tamburini*, focused on the **automatic classification of skin lesions** using **Deep Learning** techniques.
The work was carried out as an experimental project in the field of **Computer Vision** and **Artificial Intelligence**.

The thesis is written in **Italian** and provides a detailed explanation of the methodology, model development, experimental setup, and results obtained.

## 🧠 Project Description

The objective of this project is the **classification of dermatological lesions** from dermatoscopic images, within the context of the **ISIC Challenge 2016** (International Skin Imaging Collaboration).
A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** was designed and trained from scratch to distinguish between different types of skin pathologies.

The notebook implements the entire workflow, including:

* Image preprocessing and normalization
* Data augmentation
* Model design and training
* Performance evaluation

## 🧾 Abstract

Skin cancer diagnosis through dermatoscopic imaging is a critical medical challenge.
This thesis explores the application of convolutional neural networks for the automated classification of skin lesions, using the ISIC Challenge 2016 dataset.
The results demonstrate the potential of deep learning methods in supporting dermatological diagnosis by achieving robust accuracy and generalization across lesion types.
